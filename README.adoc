# ðŸŒˆ Arduino LTR381RGB Library

Allows you to read RGB, infrared, and ambient light values from the Lite-On LTR381RGB sensor.

The Lite-On LTR381RGB is a digital light sensor capable of measuring red, green, blue (RGB) color components, infrared (IR) intensity, and ambient light (ALS) levels.
It communicates over the IÂ²C bus and includes programmable gain, resolution, and interrupt thresholds, making it suitable for applications such as color detection, lux measurement, and automatic brightness or white balance adjustment.

This library provides an easy-to-use API to interface with the Lite-On LTR381RGB color and ambient light sensor.
It supports RGB, IR, and ALS measurements, as well as automatic calibration, gain and resolution control, interrupt configuration, and color space conversion (HSV/HSL).
